I already built (most of) your scales for you, you just need to use them.










Be careful about your yPositionScale. Does it seem right?





















How are you going to use d3 to find those buttons?





















They need an id!











For taking things out of the chart, you use svg.select/svg.selectAll.

For finding things across the entire page, you use d3.select/d3.selectAll























You can use classes or if statements to highlight/color, up to you!












If you're using classes, remember to reset EVERY bar before you update the highlighted bar












If you, for some reason, wanted to remove not-lowercase-letters from something, you could use

    whatever.replace(/[^a-z]*/g, '')














Are you SURE you did the height and y position correctly???









Except "low GDP countries", which will definitely be an if statement.













Try changing the padding on your scaleBand to make things look nicer!
