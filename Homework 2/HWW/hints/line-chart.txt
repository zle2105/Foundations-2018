Don't worry about the lines, you don't know how to make them yet. They don't affect what you're doing, though! They're helpful to make sure you're position things correctly though.











What attributes do you use for cx and cy? I'd recommend reading the code to see if you can get any hints. It might not be a column directly from your csv!











Make sure your dots are above the lines, or else it will interfere with hovering!

















Things that are drawn later are drawn on top of the other elements on the page.













Remember that function(d) is a lot better than fat arrows if you're trying to adjust the thing you're hovering over. Far arrow doesn't have "this" (or, I mean, it does, it just doesn't work the same)















console.log is your best friend















Capitalization can sometimes be important!!
